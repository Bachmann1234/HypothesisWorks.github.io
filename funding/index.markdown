The vast majority of Hypothesis development is unpaid work done for the love of the product
rather than the money.

Unfortunately, we need the money too if this work is to be sustainable. If you want to see
Hypothesis continue to improve, you can support its ongoing development.

The *best* way to support us is to support us on [Salt](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/drmaciver-hypothesis),
to help to pay a salary directly for working on the open source Hypothesis projects.

The second best way is to engage us for work, either with [our training courses](/training/) or
custom development, either on Hypothesis itself or in using Hypothesis to test specific things. We
can also offer support contracts. We're particularly interested in talking to people who are interested
in funding the initial development of Hypothesis for a new language. If any of these are of interest,
get in touch at [hello@hypothesis.works](mailto:hello@hypothesis.works).

Finally, if you just would like to say a little thank you, we're always after [new additions to our
library](https://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wishlist/SSZ403J9X2T0).
