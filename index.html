<h2>Most testing is ineffective</h2>

<p>
Most "automated" software testing is surprisingly manual. Every scenario the computer runs, a developer had to
write by hand. Hypothesis can fix this.
</p>

<p>
Hypothesis is a new generation of tools for automating your testing process. It combines human understanding of
your problem domain with machine intelligence to improve the quality of your testing process while spending
<em>less</em> time writing tests.

When it comes to validating the correctness of your tools, nothing comes close to the thoroughness and power of Hypothesis.

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse pull">
Hypothesis has been brilliant for expanding the coverage of our test cases, and also for making them much easier to read and understand, so we’re sure we’re testing the things we want in the way we want.

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse pull">
Hypothesis has located real defects in our code which went undetected by traditional test cases, simply because Hypothesis is more relentlessly devious about test case generation than us mere humans!

<h2>What is Hypothesis?</h2>

<p>
Hypothesis is a modern implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck">property based testing</a>, designed from the ground up for mainstream languages.
It breaks new ground in both power and usability.
</p>

<p>
Hypothesis currently has <a href="https://github.com/DRMacIver/hypothesis/">a fully featured open source Python implementation</a> and <a href=https://github.com/DRMacIver/hypothesis4j">a proof of concept Java implementation</a> that we are looking for someone to partner with to turn into a finished project. Plans for C and C++ support are also in the works.
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>
Hypothesis automates the most time consuming and error prone part of the testing process: Defining concrete examples.
</p>

<p>
A developer using Hypothesis writes a test as normal, but where they would previously have provided a concrete value
they instead provide a description of the kinds of values that this test should work for. So, for example:
</p>

{% highlight python %}
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis.strategies import text

@given(text())
def test_decode_inverts_encode(s):
    assert decode(encode(s)) == s
{% endhighlight %}

</div>
