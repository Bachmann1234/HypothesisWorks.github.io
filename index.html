<h1>Most testing is ineffective</h1>

<p>
Most "automated" software testing is surprisingly manual. Every scenario the computer runs, a developer had to
write by hand. We can do better.
</p>

<p>
Hypothesis is a new generation of tools for automating your testing process. It combines human understanding of
your problem domain with machine intelligence to improve the quality of your testing process while spending
<em>less</em> time writing tests.

When it comes to validating the correctness of your tools, nothing comes close to the thoroughness and power of Hypothesis.

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse pull">
Hypothesis has been brilliant for expanding the coverage of our test cases, and also for making them much easier to read and understand, so we’re sure we’re testing the things we want in the way we want.

<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse pull">
Hypothesis has located real defects in our code which went undetected by traditional test cases, simply because Hypothesis is more relentlessly devious about test case generation than us mere humans!
