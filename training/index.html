<p>We offer training to help companies improve their testing and software quality using Hypothesis.</p>

<h3>Workshops</h3>

<p>
  The main training courses we offer are one day workshops to get your developers up to
  speed with Hypothesis faster or to take your use of Hypothesis to the next level.
  These are hosted on site at your offices and are suitable for up to ten people at a
  time and charged at a flat rate for anyone up to that number.
</p>

<p>
These come in two forms:
</p>
<h4>Structured</h4>
<p>This is a beginner friendly workshop in which we will work through a series of examples designed to improve your understanding of how to think with property based tests. It's light on the mechanical details of how to use the library (that's what the documentation is for) and heavy on getting the right sort of mindset to use Hypothesis effectively.</p>
<h4>Unstructured</h4>
<p>This is a workshop designed for more experienced developers who are already familiar with your software (familiarity with Hypothesis is optional).  It starts with a very brief introductory talk about the nature of Hypothesis and how to use it, but the primary focus is developers writing tests for your software, with the trainer's primary purpose being to answer questions, get people unstuck, and provide suggestions of good directions to pursue and avenues that are likely to prove less fruitful.</p>
<h3>Custom</h3>
<p>If the above don't work for you (e.g. because you want a longer course or to cover a specific topic), we can always design a custom training course for your needs.</p>
