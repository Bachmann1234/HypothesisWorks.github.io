## What do you need?

* [I need my team to get better at testing](#i-need-my-team-to-get-better-at-testing)
* [I need my product to be better tested](#i-need-my-product-to-be-better-tested)
* [I need something else](#i-need-something-else-or-something-more)
* [I need to be convinced first](#why-should-my-company-do-hypothesis-training)

## Why should my company do Hypothesis training?

Hypothesis **makes your testing less labour intensive and more thorough**. You'll find
bugs you never even suspected were there in less time than your previous testing would 
have taken you.

But you don't need training to use Hypothesis! If you're not using Hypothesis already,
why not just try it out?

Hypothesis has [extensive documentation](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
and we have good introductory articles for people getting started with it [here on this
site](/articles/intro/). Your developers should start by reading there. Come back in a
week. We'll wait.

Now that you *are* using Hypothesis, ask your developers two questions:

1. Is Hypothesis useful?
2. Could we be getting more out of it?

The answers to both will be a resounding yes.


But if you want to take your usage of Hypothesis to the next level and find
even more bugs with even less work, that's where our training can help.

The exact nature of the workshop depends on what you need. To find out our options, read on,
or [go back to the table of contents](#what-do-you-need).
