Hypothesis will make your testing less labour intensive and more thorough. You'll find
bugs you never even suspected were there in less time than your existing testing will
take you.

Hypothesis has [extensive documentation](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
and we have good introductory articles for people getting started with it
[here on this site](/articles/intro/).

But if and when you want to take your usage of Hypothesis to the next level and find
even more bugs with even less work, we can help. We run one day on-site workshops for
companies to teach a group of up to ten developers at a time about Hypothesis.

The exact nature of the workshop depends on what you need:

### I need my team to get better at testing

In that case you want our **structured** workshop.

This is a beginner friendly workshop in which we will work through a series of examples
designed to improve your understanding of how to think with property based tests.

It's light on the mechanical details of how to use the library (that's what the
documentation is for) and heavy on getting the right sort of mindset to use Hypothesis effectively.

### I need my product to be better tested

In that case you want our **exploratory** workshop.

This is a workshop designed for more experienced developers who are already familiar with your software
It starts with a very brief introductory talk about the nature of Hypothesis and how to use it,
but the primary focus is developers writing tests for your software, with the trainer's primary
purpose being to answer questions, get people unstuck, and provide suggestions of good directions
to pursue and avenues that are likely to prove less fruitful.

### I need something else, or something more

If the above don't work for you (e.g. because you want a longer course or to cover a specific topic),
we can always design a custom training course for your needs.
