We are available to contract for a number of Hypothesis related support. 

## Paid development on Hypothesis features

There are a large number of directions that Hypothesis can go in and only so much time in the day. If there
is a specific Hypothesis feature that you need sooner rather than eventually or never, you can hire us to
develop them.

## Custom testing projects

Although we think anyone can use Hypothesis (even without the benefit of [our training](/training/)), sometimes
you really just want an expert to do the work, either to get you started or to give you confidence. If you have
a particular piece of software that you really need to be well tested, you can hire us to do that for you.

## Ports of Hypothesis to new languages

The Python version of Hypothesis is currently the only implementation ready to use. If you're a Python
programmer, that's great. If you're not, you're a bit out of luck.

We are very interested in porting Hypothesis to new languages, and we'd like people to fund their development.

We currently have [a prototype Java port](https://github.com/DRMacIver/hypothesis4j) and are actively considering
a port to C (which would in turn simplify the port to many other languages). People have also expressed
interests in Go and Ruby ports.

## Support contracts

We can provide support contracts guaranteeing priority to your bug reports and answering your questions when
you get stuck. Availability of these is currently somewhat limited due to capacity constraint.

# Get in touch!

If any of the above sound just like what you need, or if there's another Hypothesis related project that doesn't
quite fit, drop us a line at [hello@hypothesis.works](mailto:hello@hypothesis.works) and lets talk
details!
